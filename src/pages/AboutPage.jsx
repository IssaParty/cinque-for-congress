            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>Who I Am</h2>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              I'm Cinque Mason, a 32-year-old construction worker, small business owner, and community organizer from Colorado's 2nd District. Born and raised in Denver, I've spent my life building connections across our diverse communities—from the urban neighborhoods of Denver to the rural farming towns of the Eastern Plains, from the ski resorts of the mountains to the college campuses of Boulder and Fort Collins.
            </p>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              Unlike career politicians, I understand what it means to work for a living. I've spent the last decade in construction, building the infrastructure that keeps our communities strong. I know what it's like to worry about rent, to struggle with healthcare costs, and to watch corporations get richer while working families get squeezed.

            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>My Journey</h2>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              My path to politics wasn't traditional. I didn't go to law school or climb the corporate ladder. Instead, I built my understanding of the world through real experience:
            </p>
            <ul style={styles.contentList}>
              <li><strong>Construction Work:</strong> For over a decade, I've worked with my hands, building homes and infrastructure across Colorado. This work taught me the value of honest labor and showed me firsthand how economic policies affect real families.</li>
              <li><strong>Small Business Owner:</strong> I've run my own contracting business, dealing with the challenges of taxes, regulations, and trying to provide good jobs for my employees while competing against corporations that exploit workers.</li>
              <li><strong>International Experience:</strong> I've traveled extensively, including humanitarian work in Africa and Asia, giving me perspective on America's role in the world and the consequences of our foreign policy decisions.</li>
              <li><strong>Educational Background:</strong> I hold degrees in Communications & International Development from Colorado State University and an MBA from CU Boulder, combining academic knowledge with real-world experience.</li>
              <li><strong>Community Organizing:</strong> I've organized workers, advocated for better conditions, and seen how collective action can create change when people stand together.</li>
            </ul>

          <section style={styles.contentSection}>
            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>Why I'm Running</h2>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              I'm running for Congress because I'm tired of politicians who serve corporations instead of people. I've watched Democrats and Republicans alike take money from special interests while working families struggle. I've seen how our representatives vote for wars that enrich defense contractors while our schools crumble and our infrastructure fails.
            </p>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              In my work in construction, if you cut corners or ignore problems, buildings fall down and people get hurt. In politics, when you cut corners or ignore problems, families lose their homes, students can't afford college, and communities are destroyed by corporate greed. We need representatives who understand that consequences are real, not just talking points.

            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>My Principles</h2>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              My campaign is built on three simple principles:
            </p>
            <ul style={styles.contentList}>
              <li><strong>No Corporate Money:</strong> I don't take donations from corporations, PACs, or special interests. My loyalty is to the people of CD2, not to wealthy donors.</li>
              <li><strong>People Over Profit:</strong> Every decision should be made with working families in mind, not corporate bottom lines. When there's a conflict between what's good for people and what's good for profits, I choose people every time.</li>
              <li><strong>Full Transparency:</strong> Politics works best when it's transparent. I commit to holding regular town halls, publishing all my schedules and meetings, and being accountable to the communities I serve.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section style={styles.contentSection}>
            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>Understanding Our District</h2>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              Colorado's 2nd District is one of the most diverse in the country—geographically, economically, and politically. We have:
            </p>
            <ul style={styles.contentList}>
              <li><strong>Urban communities</strong> in Boulder and parts of Denver facing housing costs and gentrification</li>
              <li><strong>Rural farming communities</strong> dealing with water rights, agricultural challenges, and feeling left behind by economic changes</li>
              <li><strong>Mountain communities</strong> balancing tourism economies with environmental protection and affordable housing</li>
              <li><strong>Suburban families</strong> struggling with education funding, healthcare costs, and economic uncertainty</li>
              <li><strong>College students and young workers</strong> facing debt, limited job opportunities, and climate anxiety</li>
            </ul>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              Unlike many politicians who focus on just one part of our district, I've lived and worked across CD2. I understand that our diversity is our strength, but only if we have leadership that brings us together instead of dividing us.
            </p>

          <section style={styles.contentSection}>
            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>A Different Kind of Representative</h2>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              When I get to Congress, I won't be another politician climbing the ladder or positioning for the next election. I'll be there to work—to build the policies our communities need, to stand up to corporate power, and to prove that government can work for ordinary people again.
            </p>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              I know what it's like to budget carefully, to worry about unexpected expenses, to choose between spending money on necessities. I know what it's like to work long hours and still struggle to get ahead. These experiences didn't make me bitter—they made me determined to fight for a system that works for everyone, not just the wealthy.

            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>My Commitment to You</h2>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              If you elect me to represent Colorado's 2nd District, I promise:
            </p>
            <ul style={styles.contentList}>
              <li>I will never take corporate money or let special interests influence my votes</li>
              <li>I will hold monthly town halls in different parts of the district to hear directly from constituents</li>
              <li>I will publish my schedule and meeting notes so you know exactly who I'm talking to and what we're discussing</li>
              <li>I will vote based on what's best for working families, even when it's politically difficult</li>
              <li>I will work across party lines when it serves our district, and I will stand firm against bad ideas regardless of which party promotes them</li>
              <li>I will treat this job as exactly what it is: a temporary position to serve my community, not a career to build personal wealth or power</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section style={styles.contentSection}>
            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>Beyond Politics</h2>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              When I'm not working or campaigning, I love spending time outdoors—hiking, skiing, and exploring the incredible natural beauty of Colorado. I play guitar, read voraciously, and try to stay connected to friends and family who keep me grounded. I volunteer with local organizations that support workers' rights and environmental protection.
            </p>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              I live in Boulder with my partner and our dog, in a modest apartment where we worry about the same things most people in our district worry about: rent increases, healthcare costs, and whether we'll ever be able to afford to buy a home in the community we love.

          <section style={styles.contentSection}>
            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>The Choice We Face</h2>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              This election is about more than choosing between candidates—it's about choosing what kind of country we want to be. Do we want a democracy that serves corporate donors, or one that serves working families? Do we want representatives who get rich in office, or ones who understand the struggles of ordinary people?
            </p>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              I'm running because I believe we can do better. I believe in the people of Colorado's 2nd District—their intelligence, their compassion, and their determination to build a better future for their children. Together, we can prove that democracy still works when it's truly of the people, by the people, and for the people.
            </p>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              Join me in this fight. Together, we can build a movement that puts people over profit and creates real change for our communities.
