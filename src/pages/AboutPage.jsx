            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>About Me</h2>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              My name is Cinque Dominic Mason, I am named after my father and I grew up in Denver Colorado. My education was diverse and different from the average Denverite— from expeditionary schools that taught me survival skills and land navigation, to a private high school where I played basketball, to earning a degree in Communications & International Development for my interest in humanitarian work at Colorado State University. At CSU, I was deeply involved in student advocacy, even running for student body president and working to ensure student's basic needs were met.

            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>Global Work</h2>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              My interest in humanitarian work has taken me far beyond Colorado. I partnered with Indian universities on development research in '19, traveled across North and West Africa alongside refugees seeking safety in Europe in '23, built NGO capacity in Mali during a dictatorship in '24, supported feeding programs in Ethiopia since '22, and witnessed firsthand the dangers of war in Kashmir during the India-Pakistan conflict in '25. I have had the incredible opportunity to be able to see firsthand the consequences of the decisions in global power dynamics, the systems set up in post colonial rule Africa and India, and the onset and proliferation of the unchecked quick consumerism across the world. These experiences solidified my conviction that diplomacy, education, and capacity building are more powerful than militarization, coercion, and brutality.

            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              Closer to home, I've worked as a rancher across three states, a sheep shearer traveling county to county across Colorado, and today as a construction and handyman worker while living in Boulder. I hold a Master's in Business Administration from CU Boulder, but for me the corporate lifestyle is not where I get my purpose in life.

            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>Why I'm Running</h2>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              As I have worked this array of jobs have given me great insight into different lives day to day. I have seen that I am not unique in my desire to serve and give back to others. It's actually (luckily) quite the opposite, most people want to give back to the people in their own unique way, if it is with farming, building, teaching, sanitary work or medicine. People have the desire to give to their countrymen and for a long time our country and our state have always been in a unique position to be able to do that locally and abroad. Codifying in law and in culture the intrinsic human need for service for the feeling of fulfillment.

            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>Broken promises at home</h2>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              Unfortunately, it has become increasingly more difficult to do the work I love in peace while seeing the future that myself and my peers are attempting to build is being sabotaged. We are said to be the richest country in history but our elders are working long hours to pay medical bills, a box of nails is $15, and owning a home is currently unimaginable for my generation. If this is what it means to be the greatest country in the world then I don't think number 1 is a position we should want. It seems more cursed than blessed.

            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>Broken government at large</h2>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              This is not a pick yourself up by your bootstraps fix or should have planned a better financial situation. This is a systematic issue of regulatory gate keeping and artificial inflation where our tax dollars and legislators are preventing us from upward financial mobility through the financing of wars, subsidizing corporate takeovers, and protecting elitist interests in critical and standard industries. It is becoming more clear every day that our tax money is used to harm more than it is to help the masses.
            </p>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              This isn't the American dream, and this isn't Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. This is a corporate attempt of turning our country into an oligopolistic milk farm where they can milk everyone as fast and frequently as they can.
            </p>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              Since before the Global War On Terror the presidential office has been abused, making a mockery of the checks and balances of our democracy. The legislative branch has been complicit in this expansion of executive power. Which now has allowed the president with loose precedent to effectively declare war on non agreeing constituents backed by partisan ideology within the country.

            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>Global Consequences</h2>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              The current actions of the government are seriously endangering economic and global order not just at home but around the world. With the Tariffs and protectionism, weapon transfers to Israel, and use of military force without UN approval the United States has been violating key agreements that it led in the creation of. These are the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944, the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 and the UN Charter. The collapse of these agreements will undermine all diplomacy that has been written in the last 100 years. Leading allies are uncertain where America will go under any sort of pressure which in turn is creating a massive power vacuum.
            </p>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              A power vacuum internationally where powerful but: ethnic, theocratic, or oligopolistic countries are rising to fill in. Governments where there is a large and loud distinction of who's considered a socially respected human and who is not. This is a very serious issue if the Reformed World Order is written under the pretense that not everyone is equal.

            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>My position</h2>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              But I am not advocating for us to continue on pre-Trump era global policy, quite the opposite and like many others such as the founding fathers would say, no document should be static or unchanging forever. Constitutions, treaties, agreements need to be updated as time moves on. But that's done through a right and due process, through representation, dialogue, and healthy compromises. Not through a single entity's desire to consolidate power. Just as we tried to do in 1945 with the creation of the UN, and with Wilson in 1914 we have changed and we will change the outcome of this turbulence to a more just and equal society locally and globally.

            <h2 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>My Vision</h2>
            <h3 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>Foundations</h3>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              This foundational change is due at home too, as I mentioned before our domestic policy is abysmal and many citizens have been calling for a change for some time. With Obama in 2008 to Trump in 2016 each time the winner was voted in, because they promised to bring a systematic change. Change is what Americans know best. Nothing has stayed the same within our country. We have the world's oldest constitution but only because we have been able to alter it as times have changed. As the great Thomas Jefferson famously put it "The earth belongs always to the living generation... every constitution, then, and every law, naturally expires at the end of 19 years." From a very foundational standpoint, this is a dynamic foundation of society. A process that requires everyone's voice and representation as it is being codified into society.
            </p>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              This, I believe, is what makes America so great, a way to change things diplomatically and foundationally without drawing a sword and still correcting balance within our country. The first country to do it in this modern era with still the ability to be a revolutionary democracy that gives hope to the oppressed peoples of this world.
            </p>
            <h3 style={styles.contentSubtitle}>Mission statement</h3>
            <p style={styles.contentText}>
              So I see this as a very clear but potentially arduous mission. The government is not broken beyond repair — it is always evolving, and we the people have the power to change it. We have to redefine the government at all costs, this time in the hands of the people. We have to crack down on corporations, reduce the military's budget, and invest back into ourselves, our environments, food, communities, and our democracy.
