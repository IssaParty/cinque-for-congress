# üîí SECURE GOOGLE APPS SCRIPT SETUP

## üö® CRITICAL: Your Previous Script Was Exposed

Your old Google Apps Script URL was exposed in the public GitHub repository. You MUST create a new one to secure your campaign data.

## ‚úÖ STEP-BY-STEP SETUP

### 1. Create New Google Apps Script

1. **Go to:** [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. **Click:** "New Project"
3. **Replace** the default `Code.gs` content with the code from `NEW_APPS_SCRIPT.js`
4. **Update Line 21:** Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID_HERE` with your actual Google Sheet ID:
   ```javascript
   const SHEET_ID = '1E_hlG4vVeEVM-N7sr2wuDO0liXuuqLBjFFH8U0hwPl4';
   ```

### 2. Deploy the Script

1. **Click:** "Deploy" ‚Üí "New deployment"
2. **Settings:**
   - **Type:** Web app
   - **Execute as:** Me (your Google account)
   - **Who has access:** Anyone
3. **Click:** "Deploy"
4. **COPY** the new web app URL (it will be different from your old one)

### 3. Update Your Environment File

1. **Create** a new `.env` file locally (DO NOT commit to git):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit** `.env` with your NEW script URL:
   ```
   REACT_APP_GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_NEW_SCRIPT_ID_HERE/exec
   REACT_APP_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=1E_hlG4vVeEVM-N7sr2wuDO0liXuuqLBjFFH8U0hwPl4
   REACT_APP_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
   ```

### 4. Test the New Script

1. **In Google Apps Script, click:** "Run" ‚Üí "testSetup"
2. **Check logs** for success messages
3. **Test form submission** from your website

### 5. Deploy Website Updates

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### **If Forms Aren't Working:**
1. Check Google Apps Script execution logs for errors
2. Verify the SHEET_ID is correct in your script
3. Ensure the script is deployed as "Anyone can access"
4. Check that your `.env` file has the correct new URL

### **If You See Rate Limiting Errors:**
- This is working as intended to prevent spam
- Users can submit again after an hour
